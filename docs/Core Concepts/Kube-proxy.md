## 🔑 Key Points

- kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster.
- maintains network rules on nodes. 
	- These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.
- uses the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one and it's available. 
	- Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself
